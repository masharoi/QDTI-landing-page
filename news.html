      <h4>NSF awards QDTI a grant to support rapid sample transfer of samples for quantum magnetic sensors</h4>
      <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded QDTI a Phase I SBIR grant to support the development of a novel technology for transferring medical biofluid and other samples onto diamond magnetic imaging sensors. This technology will allow samples to be transferred quickly and cleanly onto an imaging sensor for a variety of high-throughput testing applications. NSF is a key federal science funding agency. <span class="more">Read More</span></p>

      <h4>QDTI awarded NIST grant to develop single nanoparticle magnetic analysis</h4>
      <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has awarded QDTI a Phase I SBIR contract to support the development of a NV imaging-based instrument for single magnetic nanoparticle analysis. Magnetic nanoparticles are used in a broad range of industries but find particularly valuable application to biomedical diagnostics and therapy. Magnetic bead products for immunoassays comprise a $1 billion market. <span class="more">Read More</span></p>

      <h4>DARPA continues its support for development of QDTI’s novel NV diamond imaging technology</h4>
      <p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has exercised its option to continue its support to QDTI for development of the company’s Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) diamond imaging technology. DARPA has been a major supporter of the development of NV technology through its QuASAR quantum sensing program. DARPA’s decision will increase its total support to QDTI for development of the technology through the agency’s SBIR program.  <span class="more">Read More</span></p>
